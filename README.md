# XORIS
Xoris is a two-player guessing game often played on a board with 11 rows and 11 columns and two dimensions. The two players take turns "putting" their checkers or unique identifying markers in a board cell of their choosing. Through the program's prompt, the coordinates of a cell are entered for placement.
